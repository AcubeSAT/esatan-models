## Description

Here you can find our ESATAN-TMS models, together with the respective analysis results. There are two directories, `cdr/` and `summer-2022/`. `cdr/` contains the model we used in our [Critical Design Review](https://www.esa.int/Education/CubeSats_-_Fly_Your_Satellite/AcubeSAT_successfully_passes_Critical_Design_Review), while `summer-2022/` contains a more updated version. There are `README` files in both directories that you can read for additional info.
